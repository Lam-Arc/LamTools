# Latest Session Work

## Goal

Finish and verify the LamTools single-UI + multi-Transport mobile refactor,
with no remaining demo/mobile business-UI entry point.

## Implemented

- Promoted `core/ui/src/app/LamToolsApp.vue` to the shared product root and
  removed `core/ui/src/demo/` and `tsconfig.demo.json`.
- Added the connection-neutral Workbench runtime and Transport contract. All
  shared UI REST/RPC access goes through the injected transport.
- Switched Tauri desktop to DirectTransport and mobile to one stable
  RemoteTransport. Mobile `App.vue` retains only pairing, native lifecycle,
  trusted-device, and connection orchestration before mounting the shared app.
- Added Noise-secured LAN/Relay tunnel handling, pairing/device identity,
  split secret storage, reconnect/route selection, sequence replay checks,
  protocol negotiation, and multi-client Core event/response routing.
- Added transport, Workbench, tunnel, pairing, gateway, and multi-client
  synchronization coverage. Corrected the context-compaction planner guard
  and no-LLM short-history behavior.
- Applied LamTools design tokens and verified the design audit is clean.

## Verification

- `cd E:\LamTools\core; py -3.14 -m pytest -q`: `1677 passed, 2 skipped`.
- `cd E:\LamTools\core\ui; npm run typecheck`: pass.
- `cd E:\LamTools\core\ui; npm run test:contract`: 67 files / 471 tests pass.
- UI build, mobile typecheck/tests/build/Capacitor sync, desktop Rust tests,
  check/format, Relay tests/format, Android Debug APK build, and website build:
  pass.
- Docker Compose static configuration passes with a supplied domain; the real
  image build is pending Docker Hub network access.
- `node .agents/skills/lam-design-spec/scripts/audit.mjs`: 69 files, 0
  deviations.
- `git diff --check`: pass (Git only reports normal LF-to-CRLF warnings).

## Working-tree Notes

The repository remains uncommitted so existing user changes are preserved.
The generated context-compaction fixture directories and `playwright-test/`
were left untouched; they are not part of the refactor implementation.

## Continuation

Use Tauri as the UI observation surface. Any future business capability should
be added once in shared UI/Workbench. Any future connection path should be
implemented behind RemoteTransport/ConnectionManager without adding a second
mobile UI.
